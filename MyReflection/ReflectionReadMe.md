# Reflection
- System.Reflection
- Reflection provides objects that describe assemblies, modules, and types. We use reflection to dynamically create an instance of a type, bind the type to an existing object, or get the type from an existing object and invoke its methods or access its fields and properties. Reflection enables you to access attributes.
- Factory + Reflection + Config enables program can be configurable and extended.
- Reflection can invoke a private constructor. 
- Reflection can invoke the different constructors.
